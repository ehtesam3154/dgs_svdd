# dgs_svdd

This was the first ever research work that i carried out so pardon me for the code isn't the most polished. I used jupyter notebook, and the deep svdd implementation is much simplified than the original implementation. Just execute the notebook sequentially (time_series>> graph>> deep_svdd) and you should be good to go.

SWaT dataset is collected by “iTrust, Centre for Research in Cyber Security, Singapore University of Technology and Design”.
